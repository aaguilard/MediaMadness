							<a>The bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties following Tony Stark's death, seeking refuse on his trip to Europe with all his classmates. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of Michelle Jones, Parker witnessed an Elemental attack and was recruited by Nick Fury to work with Mysterio to defeat the creatures. Once they had seemingly defeated these enemies, Parker handed over Stark's glasses to Mysterio, granting him access to Stark technology, only to discover that Mysterio lied to him. Recruiting Happy Hogan's help, Spider-Man followed Mysterio into London, exposing his illusions and defeated his former ally. However, upon his return into New York, doctored footage was sent to The Daily Bugle, which showed Mysterio exposing Spider-Man's true identity to the entire world as well as incriminating him for an alleged mass murder in London.<span >51</span></a>

							<a>Michelle Jones, also known as MJ, is a student at Midtown School of Science and Technology, who greatly enjoyed mocking all of her fellow students there, which included Peter Parker. Despite keeping her distance socially, Jones was eventually given the opportunity to take over from the departing Liz Toomes as the head of the Decathlon Team, and began to open up more with her fellow teammates, which included Ned Leeds and Parker. Jones was a victim of the Snap in 2018, but along with all other victims, was resurrected in the Blip five years later. Her affections were sought out by Parker and Brad Davis during Midtown Tech's trip to Europe. When she deduced Parker's identity as Spider-Man, Jones helped discover Mysterio's fraudulence, by exposing him as the one who staged the Elemental crisis. Shortly after their trip to Europe, Jones and Parker began dating. After their first date, Jones was horrified when The Daily Bugle showed a modified video of Mysterio and Spider-Man, claiming that Parker was responsible for the casualties of the Battle of London.<span >51</span></a>

							<a>Quentin Beck was a former employee at Stark Industries who became embittered as Tony Stark disregarded his entire life's work, resulting in Beck losing his job. Seeking his retribution, Beck had joined forces with other former Stark employees to create a new superhero named Mysterio, using their Combat Drones and his own hologram technology to create an illusion of his own superpowers, as well as multiple attacks from the fictional Elementals. Knowing that he needed to create world threatening illusions to sell his lies, Mysterio had then gained the trust of Nick Fury in order to get closer to Spider-Man, as he knew that Stark had gifted Spider-Man with access to the technology he needed. However, as Spider-Man discovered Mysterio's deception, he defeated Beck in London, as Beck's overconfidence resulted with his own demise. However, in the moments before his demise, Beck had managed to record his messages for J. Jonah Jameson, exposing Spider-Man's true identity while also framing him for all the Elemental attacks.<span >51</span></a>
